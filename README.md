# promoter-application
Allows for venues/promoters to browse social influencers or "Guests" party requests and can send them deals/events to
attend their venues.

To use the App, you can create a User Account or Promoter Account. You can go ahead and sign as "James Promoter" or "Sara Guest".
As "Guest" you can create Guest Event Requests. As "Promoter" you can browse Guest Event Requests, and invite that particular
request to one of your pre-created "Specials" or "Promoter Events"
